# Sentinel-2 Data Processing for Pichavaram Mangrove Forest Using CNN     

# Introduction

The project involves building a solution to analyze satellite imagery data for environmental monitoring. Utilizes Sentinel-2 satellite data to study the Pichavaram Mangrove Forest. Applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process, classify, and identify features in the satellite images. 

# Domain: Environmental Monitoring

🎨 Skills Takeaway

Image processing, Remote sensing, Deep learning (CNNs), Environmental data analysis, Data visualization.

📘 Overview of Data Processing

🌐 Data Collection:

Collects Sentinel-2 satellite imagery focused on the Pichavaram Mangrove Forest area. Imagery is retrieved using satellite data sources (e.g., Copernicus Open Access Hub).

📥 Data Preprocessing:

Image filtering and resizing to enhance feature extraction. Converts raw data into structured inputs for CNN analysis. Applies necessary preprocessing for noise reduction and image clarity.

📊 Analysis and Classification Using CNN:

Uses a Convolutional Neural Network to classify and segment key features in the forest region. Processes image data to differentiate between mangrove areas, water bodies, and other land cover types. Creates a model that can help track changes in the mangrove forest over time.
