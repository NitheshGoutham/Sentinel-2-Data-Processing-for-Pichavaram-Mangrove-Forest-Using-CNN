# Sentinel-2-Data-Processing-for-Pichavaram-Mangrove-Forest-Using-CNN
Image Proceesing

          Image classification is widely used these days for computer vision tasks such as remote sensing, scene analysis, object detection and image retrieval. In our project we are using sentinel 2 satellite data set for the purpose of land cover classification using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) algorithm and finding different properties of vegetation indices, water indices, and geology of Pichavaram mangrove forest. Mangrove forests protect the coastline from the ocean waves, Tsunami storms and Soil Erosion. They are effective at carbon sequestration and storage and mitigate climate change.
          Mapping the mangrove extent essential for its conservation. Since the geographic expansions to be covered are great, we require an automation system. This is achieved using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction. Here we have classified our data sets into three classes which are water bodies, vegetation and marshy lands. The various applications of sentinel-2 includeland monitoring, yield prediction, land cover, detection of flood volcanic eruption and landslides
